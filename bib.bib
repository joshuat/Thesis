The absorbing gaseous medium considered in this theory is subjected to irradiation by a quasi-running-wave composed of a strong pump field and a weak probe field propagating in opposite directions. Some new interesting results, not predicted by the so-called hole-burning or rate-equation model, are obtained. In particular, the probe-field-transmission peak line shape is found to be markedly different from what is expected according to the rate equations. For finite Doppler widths and a strong saturating pump field, absorption of the probe field can even change sign, and amplification of this field can actually occur. All these features are explained by a close inspection of the evolution of each atomic ensemble of given velocity. Detailed comparison with similar phenomena already observed in rf experiments is presented and permits us to clarify the new predicted effects.},

The article describes measurements of coherence properties and uses this discussion as a base from which to describe partially coherent diffraction and X-ray phase-contrast imaging, with applications in materials science, engineering and medicine. Coherent diffraction imaging methods are reviewed along with associated experiments in materials science. Proposals for experiments to be performed with the new X-ray free-electron lasers are briefly discussed. The literature on X-ray photon-correlation spectroscopy is described and the features it has in common with other coherent X-ray methods are identified. Many of the ideas used in the coherent X-ray literature have their origins in the optical and electron communities and these connections are explored. A review of the areas in which ideas from coherent X-ray methods are contributing to methods for the neutron, electron and optical communities is presented.},

The acceleration of the atom laser beam can be controlled by compensating the gravitational acceleration and we reach residual accelerations as low as 0.0027 g. The outcoupling mechanism allows for the production of a constant flux of 4.5×10 6 atoms per second and due to transverse guiding we obtain an upper limit for the mean beam width of 4.6 {\textbackslash}mu m. The transverse velocity spread is only 0.2 mm/s and thus an upper limit for the beam quality parameter is M 2 =2.5. We demonstrate the potential of the long interrogation times available with this atom laser beam by measuring the trap frequency in a single measurement. The small beam width together with the long evolution and interrogation time makes this atom laser beam a promising tool for continuous interferometric measurements.},

	abstract = {It is shown that the transverse inhomogeneity of a strong   electromagnetic beam can exert a strong effect on the electrons and   atoms of a medium. Thus, if the frequency exceeds the natural frequency   of the electron oscillations (in a plasma or in atoms), then the   electrons or atoms will be forced out of the beam field. At   subresonance frequencies, the particles will be pulled in, the force   being especially large at resonance. It is noted that this effect can   create either a rarefaction or a compression in the beam and at the   focus of the radiation, maintain a pressure gradient near an opening   from an evacuated vessel to the atmosphere, and create a channel for   the passage of charged particles in the medium. It is shown that the   strong thermal ionizing and separating effects of the ray on the medium   can be used to set up waveguide propagation conditions and to eliminate   divergence of the beam (self-focusing). It is noted that hollow beams   can give rise to directional flow and ejection of the plasma along the   beam axis for plasma transport and creation of plasma current   conductors. The possibilities of accelerating and heating plasma   electrons by a modulated beam are indicated.},

The source can be used with a range of different ionic species and can be combined with laser cooling techniques to exert unprecedented control over the ion emission, for example, producing single ions “on demand.” The beam quality is a result of a high brightness and a narrow energy distribution, both of which stem from the cold temperature ( ≈ 100 {μK)} of the atoms. The ions are produced by subjecting the cold neutral atoms to a photoionization laser, after which they become a compact source of nearly monoenergetic ions. With the application of a potential gradient, the ions form a beam that can be focused via standard ion optical techniques. They discuss estimations based on the initial size of the ion cloud and the energy distribution and show that the resulting beam has a low emittance.},

	abstract = {We describe a simple slow atom source for loading a rubidium magneto-optical trap. The source includes an effusive oven with a long heated collimation tube. Almost all components are standard vacuum parts. The heating elements and thermocouples are external to the vacuum, protecting them from the hostile hot alkali environment and allowing repair without breaking vacuum. The thermal source is followed by a Zeeman slower with a single-layer coil of variable winding pitch. The single-layer design is simple to construct and has low inductance which allows for rapid switching of the magnetic field. The coil pitch was determined by fitting the analytic form of the magnetic field for a variable winding pitch to the desired magnetic field profile required to slow atoms. The measured magnetic field for the constructed coil is in excellent agreement with the desired field. The source produces atoms at 35 m/s with a flux up to 2 x 10(10) cm(-2) s(-1) at 200 degrees C.},

We demonstrate a drastic increase of the coherence time to 21 s on the magnetic field insensitive clock transition of {87Rb} by applying the recently discovered spin self-rephasing [ C. Deutsch et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 105 020401 (2010)]. This result confirms the general nature of this new mechanism and thus shows its applicability in atom clocks and quantum memories. A systematic investigation of all relevant frequency shifts and noise contributions yields a stability of 2.4×10-11τ-1/2, where τ is the integration time in seconds. Based on a set of technical improvements, the presented frequency standard is predicted to rival the stability of microwave fountain clocks in a potentially much more compact setup.},

Since the ions gain a large amount of kinetic energy while building up negative potential energy, plasmas are usually heated to a moderately coupled state that is almost independent of the initial temperature. We show how this process is related to the establishment of Coulomb structure in the final plasma state. Several possibilities for reducing the heating by the introduction of structure in the initial state, i.e., the gas before ionization, are then discussed.

The anti-influenza virus drug amantadine hydrochloride significantly attenuated the inward current induced by hyperpolarization of oocyte membranes. Mutations in the M2 membrane-spanning domain that confer viral resistance to amantadine produced currents that were resistant to the drug. Analysis of the currents of these altered M2 proteins suggests that the channel pore is formed by the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein. The wild-type M2 channel was found to be regulated by {pH.} The wild-type M2 ion channel activity is proposed to have a pivotal role in the biology of influenza virus infection.},

	abstract = {Radiation damage is the main problem which prevents the determination of the structure of a single biological macromolecule at atomic resolution using any kind of microscopy. This is true whether neutrons, electrons or X-rays are used as the illumination. For neutrons, the cross-section for nuclear capture and the associated energy deposition and radiation damage could be reduced by using samples that are fully deuterated and {15N-labelled} and by using fast neutrons, but single molecule biological microscopy is still not feasible. For naturally occurring biological material, electrons at present provide the most information for a given amount of radiation damage. Using phase contrast electron microscopy on biological molecules and macromolecular assemblies of approximately 10(5) molecular weight and above, there is in theory enough information present in the image to allow determination of the position and orientation of individual particles: the application of averaging methods can then be used to provide an atomic resolution structure. The images of approximately 10,000 particles are required. Below 10(5) molecular weight, some kind of crystal or other geometrically ordered aggregate is necessary to provide a sufficiently high combined molecular weight to allow for the alignment. In practice, the present quality of the best images still falls short of that attainable in theory and this means that a greater number of particles must be averaged and that the molecular weight limitation is somewhat larger than the predicted limit. For X-rays, the amount of damage per useful elastic scattering event is several hundred times greater than for electrons at all wavelengths and energies and therefore the requirements on specimen size and number of particles are correspondingly larger. Because of the lack of sufficiently bright neutron sources in the foreseeable future, electron microscopy in practice provides the greatest potential for immediate progress.},

The final temperature achieved was (a somewhat disappointing) 17 {μK.} Experimental studies and theoretical analysis of this cooling process were carried out, which explain that the temperature limit is due to an equilibrium between the small fraction of total thermal energy that is removed per Sisyphus cycle and the multiple photon recoils that are required to complete each cycle. Light-induced collisional loss made it difficult to operate under conditions where a larger fraction of the energy would be removed. A method for storing atoms in an optical trap with only a single confined spin state is also demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Protein characterization plays a role in two key aspects of structural proteomics. The first is the quality assessment of the produced protein preparations. Obtaining well diffracting crystals is one of the major bottlenecks in the structure-determination pipeline. Often, this is caused by the poor quality of the protein preparation used for crystallization trials. Hence, it is essential to perform an extensive quality assessment of the protein preparations prior to crystallization and to use the results in the evaluation of the process. Here, a protein-production and crystallization strategy is proposed with threshold values for protein purity (95\%) and monodispersity (85\%) below which a further optimization of the protein-production process is strongly recommended. The second aspect is the determination of protein characteristics such as domains, oligomeric state, post-translational modifications and protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. In this paper, applications and new developments of protein-characterization methods using {MS}, fluorescence spectroscopy, static light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering within the {EC} Structural Proteomics in Europe contract are described.

The joint atomic-scale resolutions in space and time, and sensitivity reached, make it possible to determine complex transient structures and assemblies in different phases. These applications include studies of isolated chemical reactions (molecular beams), interfaces, surfaces and nanocrystals, self-assembly, and {2D} crystalline fatty-acid bilayers. In {4D} {UEM}, we are now able, using timed, single-electron packets, to image nano-to-micro scale structures of materials and biological cells. Future applications of these methods are foreseen across areas of physics, chemistry, and biology.},

The loading is a dynamical process determined by a loading rate and a density dependent loss rate. The loading rate depends on cooling and the flux of atoms into the trapping volume, and the loss rate is due to excited state collisions induced by the {MOT} light fields. From this study we found ways to optimize the loading of the optical dipole trap. Key ingredients for maximum loading are found to be a reduction of the hyperfine repump intensity, increased detuning of the {MOT} light, and a displacement of the optical dipole trap center with respect to the {MOT.} A factor of 2 increase in the number of loaded atoms is demonstrated by using a hyperfine repump beam with a shadow in it. In this way we load {8×10685Rb} atoms into a 1 {mK} deep optical dipole trap with a waist of 58 {\textbackslash}mu m, which is 40\% of the atoms initially trapped in the {MOT.}},

This new imaging scheme could be extended to other impurities such as ions, and is ideally suited to equilibrium and dynamical studies of complex many-body phenomena involving strongly interacting particles.

At present, significant disagreement exists regarding features of the disordered {Bose–Hubbard} model, which is used to study disorder in strongly correlated bosonic systems. Here, by measuring transport in a disordered optical lattice, we discover a disorder-induced superfluid-to-insulator transition in this system, in quantitative agreement with a predicted {superfluid–Bose-glass} transition from recent numerical simulations. Both the superfluid-to-insulator transition and correlated changes in the atomic quasimomentum distribution—which verify a simple model for the interplay of disorder and interactions in this system—are phenomena new to the unit-filling regime explored in this work. We find that increasing disorder strength generically leads to greater dissipation, excluding predictions of a disorder-induced or ‘re-entrant’ superfluid. Whereas the absence of a re-entrant superfluid may be explained by finite temperature, the measured bounds on entropy strongly constrain theory.},

The spectral properties of single photons emitted by the atom were studied with a narrow-band scanning cavity. We find that the atomic fluorescence spectrum is dominated by the spectral width of the exciting laser light field. In addition we observe a spectral broadening of the atomic fluorescence light due to the Doppler effect. This allows us to determine the mean kinetic energy of the trapped atom corresponding to a temperature of 105 {μK.} This simple single-atom trap is the key element for the generation of atom-photon entanglement required for future applications in quantum communication and a first loophole-free test of Bell’s inequality.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a simple scheme to achieve fast, accelerating (runaway) evaporative cooling of optically trapped atoms by tilting the optical potential with a magnetic field gradient. Runaway evaporation is possible in this trap geometry due to the weak dependence of vibration frequencies on trap depth, which preserves atomic density during the evaporation process. Using this scheme, we show that Bose-Einstein condensation with ∼105 cesium atoms can be realized in 2–4 s of forced evaporation. The evaporation speed and energetics are consistent with the three-dimensional evaporation picture, despite the fact that atoms can only leave the trap in the direction of tilt.},

The sensitivity and time resolution were sufficient to capture the time-dependent pair correlation function as the system evolved from the solid to the liquid state.

A new design is presented here, using a single integrated circuit originally intended for controlling dc motors. A digital input signal switches a unipolar power supply bidirectionally through the voice coil. Short high-current pulses are generated on the transitions to ensure rapid shutter action, while a low holding current reduces the power requirement and heating of the actuator. The circuit can reverse the current to brake the shutter and reduce the impact at the end of its travel. With a focused laser beam, the shutter achieves rise times below 500 ns. A method for producing variable length pulses is also described, demonstrating durations as short as 700 ns.},

Analyses of the dynamics of damage formation3, 4, 5 suggest that the conventional damage barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per Å2 with X-rays of 12 {keV} energy or 1 Å wavelength2) may be extended at very high dose rates and very short exposure times. Here we have used computer simulations to investigate the structural information that can be recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by single protein molecules and small assemblies. Estimations of radiation damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse intensity and sample size show that experiments using very high X-ray dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural information before radiation damage destroys the sample. We predict that such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers6, 7 that are currently under development, in combination with container-free sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new approach to structural determinations with X-rays.},

	abstract = {Femtosecond electron diffraction {(FED)} has the potential to directly observe transition state processes. The relevant motions for this barrier-crossing event occur on the hundred femtosecond time-scale. Recent advances in the development of high-flux electron pulse sources with the required time resolution and sensitivity to capture barrier-crossing processes are described in the context of attaining atomic level details of such structural dynamics—seeing chemical events as they occur. Initial work focused on the ordered-to-disordered phase transition of Al under strong driving conditions for which melting takes on nm or molecular scale dimensions. This work has been extended to Au, which clearly shows a separation in time-scales for lattice heating and melting. It also demonstrates that superheated face-centred cubic {(FCC)} metals melt through thermal mechanisms involving homogeneous nucleation to propagate the disordering process. A new concept exploiting electron–electron correlation is introduced for pulse characterization and determination of t=0 to within 100 fs as well as for spatial manipulation of the electron beam. Laser-based methods are shown to provide further improvements in time resolution with respect to pulse characterization, absolute t=0 determination, and the potential for electron acceleration to energies optimal for time-resolved diffraction.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a new method for nondestructive imaging of laser-cooled atoms. This spatial heterodyne technique forms a phase image by interfering a strong reference laser beam with a weak probe beam that passes through the cold atom cloud. The figure of merit equals or exceeds that of phase-contrast imaging, and the technique can be used over a wider range of spatial scales. We show images of a dark-spot magneto-optic trap taken with imaging fluences as low as 61 {pJ/cm2} at a detuning of 11Γ , resulting in 0.0004 photons scattered per atom.},

	abstract = {Ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a versatile tool with which to investigate fundamental properties of quantum many-body systems. In particular, the high degree of control of experimental parameters has allowed the study of many interesting phenomena, such as quantum phase transitions and quantum spin dynamics. Here we demonstrate how such control can be implemented at the most fundamental level of a single spin at a specific site of an optical lattice. Using a tightly focused laser beam together with a microwave field, we were able to flip the spin of individual atoms in a Mott insulator with sub-diffraction-limited resolution, well below the lattice spacing. The Mott insulator provided us with a large two-dimensional array of perfectly arranged atoms, in which we created arbitrary spin patterns by sequentially addressing selected lattice sites after freezing out the atom distribution. We directly monitored the tunnelling quantum dynamics of single atoms in the lattice prepared along a single line, and observed that our addressing scheme leaves the atoms in the motional ground state. The results should enable studies of entropy transport and the quantum dynamics of spin impurities, the implementation of novel cooling schemes, and the engineering of quantum many-body phases and various quantum information processing applications.},

The narrower resonance is exploited to create a double species condensate with tunable interactions. Our system opens the way to the exploration of double species Mott insulators and, more in general, of the quantum phase diagram of the two-species Bose-Hubbard model.},
