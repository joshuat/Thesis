The increased coherent flux from modern X-ray sources is being matched with an associated development in experimental methods. This article reviews the literature describing the ideas that utilize the increased brilliance from modern X-ray sources. It explores how ideas in coherent X-ray science are leading to developments in other areas, and vice versa. The article describes measurements of coherence properties and uses this discussion as a base from which to describe partially coherent diffraction and X-ray phase-contrast imaging, with applications in materials science, engineering and medicine. Coherent diffraction imaging methods are reviewed along with associated experiments in materials science. Proposals for experiments to be performed with the new X-ray free-electron lasers are briefly discussed. The literature on X-ray photon-correlation spectroscopy is described and the features it has in common with other coherent X-ray methods are identified. Many of the ideas used in the coherent X-ray literature have their origins in the optical and electron communities and these connections are explored. A review of the areas in which ideas from coherent X-ray methods are contributing to methods for the neutron, electron and optical communities is presented.},

The acceleration of the atom laser beam can be controlled by compensating the gravitational acceleration and we reach residual accelerations as low as 0.0027 g. The outcoupling mechanism allows for the production of a constant flux of 4.5×10 6 atoms per second and due to transverse guiding we obtain an upper limit for the mean beam width of 4.6 {\textbackslash}mu m. The transverse velocity spread is only 0.2 mm/s and thus an upper limit for the beam quality parameter is M 2 =2.5. We demonstrate the potential of the long interrogation times available with this atom laser beam by measuring the trap frequency in a single measurement. The small beam width together with the long evolution and interrogation time makes this atom laser beam a promising tool for continuous interferometric measurements.},

	abstract = {It is shown that the transverse inhomogeneity of a strong   electromagnetic beam can exert a strong effect on the electrons and   atoms of a medium. Thus, if the frequency exceeds the natural frequency   of the electron oscillations (in a plasma or in atoms), then the   electrons or atoms will be forced out of the beam field. At   subresonance frequencies, the particles will be pulled in, the force   being especially large at resonance. It is noted that this effect can   create either a rarefaction or a compression in the beam and at the   focus of the radiation, maintain a pressure gradient near an opening   from an evacuated vessel to the atmosphere, and create a channel for   the passage of charged particles in the medium. It is shown that the   strong thermal ionizing and separating effects of the ray on the medium   can be used to set up waveguide propagation conditions and to eliminate   divergence of the beam (self-focusing). It is noted that hollow beams   can give rise to directional flow and ejection of the plasma along the   beam axis for plasma transport and creation of plasma current   conductors. The possibilities of accelerating and heating plasma   electrons by a modulated beam are indicated.},

We collect atoms in a magneto-optical trap {(MOT)} and then capture the atoms in a magnetic quadrupole trap and force rf evaporation. We then transfer the resulting cold dense cloud into a spatially mode-matched optical dipole trap by lowering the quadrupole field gradient to below gravity. This technique combines the efficient capture of atoms from a {MOT} into a magnetic trap with the rapid evaporation of optical dipole traps; the approach is insensitive to the peak quadrupole gradient and the precise trapping beam waist.

	abstract = {Radiation damage is the main problem which prevents the determination of the structure of a single biological macromolecule at atomic resolution using any kind of microscopy. This is true whether neutrons, electrons or X-rays are used as the illumination. For neutrons, the cross-section for nuclear capture and the associated energy deposition and radiation damage could be reduced by using samples that are fully deuterated and {15N-labelled} and by using fast neutrons, but single molecule biological microscopy is still not feasible. For naturally occurring biological material, electrons at present provide the most information for a given amount of radiation damage. Using phase contrast electron microscopy on biological molecules and macromolecular assemblies of approximately 10(5) molecular weight and above, there is in theory enough information present in the image to allow determination of the position and orientation of individual particles: the application of averaging methods can then be used to provide an atomic resolution structure. The images of approximately 10,000 particles are required. Below 10(5) molecular weight, some kind of crystal or other geometrically ordered aggregate is necessary to provide a sufficiently high combined molecular weight to allow for the alignment. In practice, the present quality of the best images still falls short of that attainable in theory and this means that a greater number of particles must be averaged and that the molecular weight limitation is somewhat larger than the predicted limit. For X-rays, the amount of damage per useful elastic scattering event is several hundred times greater than for electrons at all wavelengths and energies and therefore the requirements on specimen size and number of particles are correspondingly larger. Because of the lack of sufficiently bright neutron sources in the foreseeable future, electron microscopy in practice provides the greatest potential for immediate progress.},

	abstract = {Protein characterization plays a role in two key aspects of structural proteomics. The first is the quality assessment of the produced protein preparations. Obtaining well diffracting crystals is one of the major bottlenecks in the structure-determination pipeline. Often, this is caused by the poor quality of the protein preparation used for crystallization trials. Hence, it is essential to perform an extensive quality assessment of the protein preparations prior to crystallization and to use the results in the evaluation of the process. Here, a protein-production and crystallization strategy is proposed with threshold values for protein purity (95\%) and monodispersity (85\%) below which a further optimization of the protein-production process is strongly recommended. The second aspect is the determination of protein characteristics such as domains, oligomeric state, post-translational modifications and protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. In this paper, applications and new developments of protein-characterization methods using {MS}, fluorescence spectroscopy, static light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering within the {EC} Structural Proteomics in Europe contract are described.

The loading is a dynamical process determined by a loading rate and a density dependent loss rate. The loading rate depends on cooling and the flux of atoms into the trapping volume, and the loss rate is due to excited state collisions induced by the {MOT} light fields. From this study we found ways to optimize the loading of the optical dipole trap. Key ingredients for maximum loading are found to be a reduction of the hyperfine repump intensity, increased detuning of the {MOT} light, and a displacement of the optical dipole trap center with respect to the {MOT.} A factor of 2 increase in the number of loaded atoms is demonstrated by using a hyperfine repump beam with a shadow in it.

	abstract = {We describe a simple experimental technique which allows us to store a single {87Rb} atom in an optical dipole trap. Due to light-induced two-body collisions during the loading stage of the trap the maximum number of captured atoms is locked to one. This collisional blockade effect is confirmed by the observation of photon antibunching in the detected fluorescence light. The spectral properties of single photons emitted by the atom were studied with a narrow-band scanning cavity. We find that the atomic fluorescence spectrum is dominated by the spectral width of the exciting laser light field. In addition we observe a spectral broadening of the atomic fluorescence light due to the Doppler effect. This allows us to determine the mean kinetic energy of the trapped atom corresponding to a temperature of 105 {μK.} This simple single-atom trap is the key element for the generation of atom-photon entanglement required for future applications in quantum communication and a first loophole-free test of Bell’s inequality.},

Analyses of the dynamics of damage formation3, 4, 5 suggest that the conventional damage barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per Å2 with X-rays of 12 {keV} energy or 1 Å wavelength2) may be extended at very high dose rates and very short exposure times. Here we have used computer simulations to investigate the structural information that can be recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by single protein molecules and small assemblies. Estimations of radiation damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse intensity and sample size show that experiments using very high X-ray dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural information before radiation damage destroys the sample. We predict that such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers6, 7 that are currently under development, in combination with container-free sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new approach to structural determinations with X-rays.},

The relevant motions for this barrier-crossing event occur on the hundred femtosecond time-scale. Recent advances in the development of high-flux electron pulse sources with the required time resolution and sensitivity to capture barrier-crossing processes are described in the context of attaining atomic level details of such structural dynamics—seeing chemical events as they occur. Initial work focused on the ordered-to-disordered phase transition of Al under strong driving conditions for which melting takes on nm or molecular scale dimensions. This work has been extended to Au, which clearly shows a separation in time-scales for lattice heating and melting. It also demonstrates that superheated face-centred cubic {(FCC)} metals melt through thermal mechanisms involving homogeneous nucleation to propagate the disordering process. A new concept exploiting electron–electron correlation is introduced for pulse characterization and determination of t=0 to within 100 fs as well as for spatial manipulation of the electron beam. Laser-based methods are shown to provide further improvements in time resolution with respect to pulse characterization, absolute t=0 determination, and the potential for electron acceleration to energies optimal for time-resolved diffraction.},

Using a tightly focused laser beam together with a microwave field, we were able to flip the spin of individual atoms in a Mott insulator with sub-diffraction-limited resolution, well below the lattice spacing. The Mott insulator provided us with a large two-dimensional array of perfectly arranged atoms, in which we created arbitrary spin patterns by sequentially addressing selected lattice sites after freezing out the atom distribution. We directly monitored the tunnelling quantum dynamics of single atoms in the lattice prepared along a single line, and observed that our addressing scheme leaves the atoms in the motional ground state. The results should enable studies of entropy transport and the quantum dynamics of spin impurities, the implementation of novel cooling schemes, and the engineering of quantum many-body phases and various quantum information processing applications.},

	abstract = {A method of stably trapping, cooling, and manipulating atoms on a continuous-wave basis is proposed using resonance radiation pressure forces. Use of highly focused laser beams and atomic beam injection should give a very deep trap for confining single atoms or gases at temperatures ∼ 10-6 {°K.} An analysis of the saturation properties of radiation pressure forces is given.},
