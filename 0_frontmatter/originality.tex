The following work was contributed by the author:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simulating the optical dipole trap to determine appropriate parameters.
\item Updating master-oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) designs to deal with new tapered amplifier mounts from the Eagleyard Photonics and M2K suppliers.
\item Constructing a new $780\,\unit{nm}$, $2\,\unit{W}$ MOPA with an Eagleyard Photonics tapered amplifier.
\item Designing and constructing a quadrupole magnetic steering device.
\item Designing, constructing and integrating a crossed optical dipole trap with the cold-atom electron source.
\item Implementing absorption imaging and Labview software to interface with it.
\item Implementing software to analyse absorption images.
\end{itemize}

Substantial assistance from Corey, Dan, Dave, Dene, Paul, Rob and Rory helped this project transition from ``dipole trapping is happening... probably'' to ``there is a crossed dipole trap!''. Thankyou for all your help.
