The following work was contributed by the author:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simulating the ODT in order to determine appropriate parameters.
\item Updating MOPA designs to deal with new TA mounts from the Eagleyard and M2K suppliers.
\item Constructing a new $780\,\unit{nm}$, $2\,\unit{W}$ MOPA with an Eagleyard TA.
\item Designing and constructing a quadrupole magnetic steering device.
\item Designing, constructing and integrating a crossed ODT with the CAES.
\item Implementing absorption imaging and Labview software to interface with it.
\item Implementing software to analysing absorption images.
\end{itemize}

The transition from ``dipole trapping is happening... probably'' to ``there is a crossed dipole trap'' was due to the hard work of Rory, Paul, Corey and Dave not the author.
