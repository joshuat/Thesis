\section{Introduction}

% Motivation
The University of Melbourne's cold-atom electron source aims to be able to create high-brightness, high-coherence electon bunches and use them to perform coherent diffractive imaging. Imaging of nanoscale objects such as biological molecules\cite{dwyer_femtosecond_2006, williamson_clocking_1997} and defects in solid-state devices\cite{siwick_atomic-level_2003} by ultrafast, single-shot electron diffractive imaging would provide important information about structure and dynamic processes.

Membrane proteins, for example, are very important for some reason \emph{(ASK VIVIEN get some references)}. Determining the structure of these molecules is a key step in understanding their chemical and biological function. The importance of knowing a the atomic structure of biomolecules is exemplefied by the enourmous progress made in various fields of biology once the double-helical structure of DNA was determined from x-ray images in 1953\cite{watson_molecular_1953}. Once a protein's structure and function are known then it becomes possible to design drugs\cite{pinto_influenza_1992} where needed and to more fully understand how the biological system behaves.

In order to determine the structure of these biological molecules atomic, sub-nanometre imaging resolution is required. A number of techniques are available for determing these structures \cite{nettleship_methods_2008, svergun_small-angle_2003, opella_structure_2004} however the most successful has been x-ray crystallography \cite{kendrew_three-dimensional_1958, uson_advances_1999}. Unfortunately the process of crystallising these proteins is difficult and to date relatively few have been crystallised \cite{geerlof_impact_2006}.

New imaging techniques and light sources such as x-ray free electron lasers and  ultrafast single-shot diffraction have been driven by the goal of overcoming the limitations of x-ray crystallography. Ultrafast single-shot diffraction imaging also has the potential to determine the dynamic structure of biological molecules.

\subsection{Coherent diffractive imagine with electrons}
X-ray diffraction from crystals was first observed a century ago\cite{bragg_x-rays_1912} and resulted in a Nobel prize being awarded to William Bragg and his son. Since then \gls{cdi} has been performed on a myriad of different samples with coherent beams of x-rays and electrons.

\subsubsection{Single-shot diffractive imaging}
Single-shot diffractive imaging with an x-ray source of sufficient brightness should be able to produce a diffaction pattern from scattered x-rays from a single molecule before the molecule is destroyed by the Coulomb explosion which follows the photoionisation within the molecule \cite{henderson_potential_1995, neutze_potential_2000}. Single-shot imaging aims to avoid the need for crystallisation with x-ray imaging since with a sufficiently bright source should allow imaging of any molecule.

\subsection{Melbourne cold-atom source}
we do... stuff
aim to get
\begin{itemize}
    \item brightness (give definition)
    \item coherence
    \item bunches
\end{itemize}

problems
\begin{itemize}
    \item coulomb explosion (bunchshaping)
    \item bunch length
    \item brightness (dipole trap and other stuff)
\end{itemize}


uniform density ellipsoidal bunchs -> coulomb explosion reversal\cite{van_der_geer_simulated_2007}
