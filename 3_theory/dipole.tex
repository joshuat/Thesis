\section{Optical dipole trapping}

Consider swapping theory and setup section. So that the theory has context rather than coming out of the blue.
Overview of experimental setup should be before this.
Should I go into detail on MOT theory?
Describe but don't go into great detail. In Andy's honours thesis he devotes a couple of pages to slower + MOT etc. The same is probably appropriate for this.

If so then:
\begin{itemize}
	\item zeeman slower
	\item optical mollasses
	\item magnetic trapping
	\item electron excitation and ionisation
	\item dipole trapping
\end{itemize}


First attempt:

The \gls{caes} consists of a number of devices which are descibed below. Many of these devices are staples of atom optics experiments and are used in hundreds of laboratories today, all over the world.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Rb oven
	\item zeeman slower
	\item MOT
	\item electron excitation and ionisation
	\item dipole trapping
\end{itemize}
