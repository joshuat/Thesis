\chapter{Experiment}

The \gls{caes} at the University of Melbourne has be assembled over a number of years. The experimental cycle can be divided into several parts which will be briefly descibed in this chapter. More details of the various experimental apparatus can be found in the group's recent papers \cite{bell_slow_2010, mcculloch_arbitrarily_2011, saliba_spatial_2012} and theses \cite{mcculloch_towards_2012, sheludko_shaped_2010, saliba_partially_2011}.


\section{Magneto-Optic Trap}

The first stage of the experiment is trapping rubidium atoms in a \gls{mot}. An oven is used to create Rubidium vapour with a temperature around 350K which is collimated and directed down the axis of the Zeeman slower. The Zeeman slower slows the atoms down such that when they reach the main chamber they can be trapped by the combined magnetic and optical traps.


\subsection{Rubidium Oven}

\end{wrapfigure}

Rubidium atoms in a reservoir are heated in an oven to approximately $80\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. The resulting vapour effuses through a heated drift tube and is then incident on a `cold-cup'' aperture resulting in a collimated beam. At this point the atoms have a velocity in the region of 300m/s. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:oven}


\subsection{Zeeman Slower}
The Zeeman slower cools the atoms atoms from having a velocity of order 300m/s to 35m/s. This is achieved with doppler cooling using red-detuned light. As the atoms slow down the resonance condition changes so a magnetic coil with a tapered pitch is used to maintain the interaction. Another solution which is not implemented in this system is to use a frequency `chirp' in the cooling light.

An Eagleyards tapered amplifier seeded with light from two \glspl{ecdl} is used for the doppler cooling. The first \gls{ecdl} produces the cooling light and the second is used to repump any atoms that fall into a dark state.

The \gls{ecdl} is locked on to the appropriate frequency using a saturated absorption configuration\cite{maguire_theoretical_2006}.

\subsection{Quasi-Mirror Magneto-Optic Trap}
\glspl{mot} have been used extensively in atom-optics laboratories to trap and cool atoms of many species. The physics of \glspl{mot} is well documented and understood\cite{metcalf_laser_1999}.

A conventional \gls{mot} consists of six beams which are able to damp the velocity of atoms is all directions where the beam overlap. A simpler design using only four beams is the ``mirror-MOT''. Mirror-MOTs typically suffer from a reduced trapping volume\cite{reichel_atomic_1999}.

In the \gls{caes} the accelerating structure required to extract the electron bunches is integrated with the mirror-MOT, ``Quasi-Mirror Magneto-Optical Trap'' (QMMOT)\cite{hanssen_using_2006}. Figure \ref{fig:qmmot} shows a schematic of the QMMOT where one of the plates is transmissive and the other reflective and both can be charged to provide the accelerating electric field.

To extract electrons a static electric field is applied once the cloud has been ionised.}
\end{figure}

The laser power for the \gls{mot} is supplied by a Toptica \gls{ta} seeded by the cooling and repump \glspl{ecdl} which are locked onto the appropriate atomic transistions using saturated absorption setups. A pair of magnetic coils external to the vacuum system in an anti-Helpholtz configuration proved the magnetic fields for the \gls{mot}.

\section{Electron Generation}

The generation of electrons is a central part of the \gls{caes} and each of the two stages has its own light source.

\subsection{Excitation}

The excitation of the atoms in the cloud can be done in one of two ways in the \gls{caes}. The first method of excitation is a $50\,\unit{\mu s}$ exposure of light from an \gls{ecdl} and the second method is to use a pulse from a Newport 3960 fs Tsunami which is able to produce $35\,\unit{fs}$ long bunches.

\subsubsection{ECDL Excitation}

The \gls{ecdl} is locked onto the $5 ^2 S_{3/2} F=3\rightarrow5 ^2 P_{3/2} F=4$ transition of rubidium using saturated absorption and the exposure is controlled with an \gls{aom}. The excitation \gls{ecdl} beam shares much of its beam path with that of the femtosecond laser and a mirror on a flip mount is used to determine which used for excitation at a given time.
.
\subsubsection{Femtosecond Excitation}

The Newport 3960 fs Tsunami produces approximately $80\,\unit{fs}$ long pulses of light with a wavelength centered around $800\,\unit{nm}$ with a $20\,\unit{nm}$ linewidth.\cite{mcculloch_towards_2012} Femtosecond excitation allows the \gls{caes} to produce electron bunchs that are picoseconds long.

\subsection{Shaping}

The \gls{caes} has the ability to create shaped electron bunches. This is done by applying a phase mask to the excitation beam with a \gls{slm}. The shaped excitation beam causes the distribution of excited atoms in the atom cloud to be proportionally shaped. This results in electron bunches with the same shap as the excitation beam.

\section{Optical Dipole Trap}

The design of the \gls{odt} began in 2011 and the first trapping was observed in late 2012.
{\color{red} more stuff}

\subsection{Tapered Amplifier}
The \gls{ta} serves as the light source for the \gls{odt} and is built from an Eagleyards $780\,\unit{nm}$ $w\,\unit{W}$ CR-Mounted \gls{ta} seeded by a homebuilt \gls{ecdl}. Due to a change in the mounting of the \gls{ta} chip it was necessary to redesign part of David Sheludko's \gls{mopa} design\cite{sheludko_shaped_2010}. A number of other changes to the original \gls{mopa} design were also made to allow more flexibility during alignment.

{\color{red} more details? pictures?}

The \gls{ecdl} provides approximately $25\,\unit{mW}$ of injection seed with a linewidth typically below $300\,\unit{kHz}$. The seed laser is focussed onto the input facet of the \gls{ta} with a high \gls{na} lens\footnote{Thorlabs C230TM-B f=$4.5\,\unit{mm}$ $0.55\,\unit{NA}$}. The beam from the output facet of the \gls{ta} is collimated with two lens due to the high astygmatism in the output beam. The first lens is a high \gls{na} aspheric lens\footnote{Thorlabs C330TM-B f=$3.1\,\unit{mm}$ $0.68\,\unit{NA}$} and the second is a cylindrical lens\footnote{Unknown provenance f=$50\,\unit{mm}$} to counter the horizontal divergence. The outgoing beam then passes through a double stage optical isolator to prevent optical feedback causing damage to the \gls{ta}. The maximum output power of the \gls{ta}, after the isolator, is approximately $1.75\,\unit{W}$.

A small portion of the seed beam is siphoned into a saturated absorption setup to allow locking of the seed beam to the resonances of rubidium. This is not particularly useful during normal operation since the laser is usually detuned well beyond the resonances. When the \gls{ta} is running optical feedback interferes with the \gls{ecdl} causing further issues with visually deciphering, let alone locking to, the saturated absorption signal.

The output beam is coupled into a polarisation maintaining, single-mode fibre with the output end at the main experiment. At maximum power the power of the beam out of the fibre is apprimately 40\% of the input power. Most of the power loss is due to the non-Gaussian profile of the \gls{ta} beam. While 60\% of the power is lost the major advantage of fibre coupling the beam is that the output beam is almost perfectly Gaussian in profile which is a necessity for \glspl{odt}.

A fraction of a percent of the light reflecting off the final mirror before the fibre mount transmits throught the mirror. This light is incident on a wavemeter and is used to monitor the wavelength of the output beam as well as check that the light is of a single wavelength. Occasionally the seed laser will operate in two modes simultaneously and the \gls{ta} amplifies both modes which makes the trapping less predictable.

An old hard disc drive was used to create a shutter\cite{scholten_enhanced_2007} that is connected to the computer that runs the experiment. The shutter has a response time of $6\,\unit{ms}$ which must be taken into account when scheduling the timing of the experiment.

A portion of the seed beam is directed into a saturated absorption setup which, due to the detuning of the ECDL, is usually not useful. A tiny portion of the amplified beam transmits through the final mirror and is incident on the input to a wavemeter. A computer controlled shutter is used to turn the trapping beam on and off. The amplified beam has been coupled into a polarisation maintaining, single mode fibre.}

\subsection{Optical Dipole Trap}

\Gls{odt} consist of focussed Gaussian laser beams. The output of the \gls{ta} fibre provides a Gaussian beam and the focussing optics described in this section produce the focussed beam.

The output end of the \gls{ta} fibre is mounted in to a cage to allow precise alignment of lens for focussing (the `objective' lens) and beam expansion and shrinking. While the potential for shinking and expanding the beam incident on the objective lens is available it was not used in the final configuration.

There is a limited amount of optical access to the \gls{mot} available and the \gls{odt} used two almost orthogonal beam paths the second of which is shared with the $480\,\unit{nm}$ ionisation laser. Both of the paths are approximately $60^{\circ}$ from horizontal. All the windows to the vacuum system are \gls{ar} coated for $780\,\unit{nm}$ light.

{\color{red} picture of beam paths with correct angles?}

The distance from one window to the opposite is $412.3\,\unit{mm}$ and the \gls{mot} should be situated halfway between them. The objective lens\footnote{Thorlabs AC508-250-B-ML f=$250\,\unit{mm}$} have a focal length of $250\,\unit{mm}$ which gives sufficient space to allow for adjustments of the beam waists. After the window of the first beam is another $250\,\unit{mm}$ lens to re-collimate the beam. This collimated beam is then propagated through free space to the second beam axis.

The second beam axis is shared with the blue, nanosecond-pulse ionisation laser. A long-pass dichroic mirror\footnote{Thorlabs DMLP567L} is used to combine the two beam paths. The focussing optics for the ionisation and the \gls{odt} path are located before the dichroic. The objective lens for the second beam of the \gls{odt} is a $300\,\unit{mm}$ lens due to the extra distance imposed by the dichroic.

As mentioned in \ref{odt_polarisation} the polarisation of the second beam must be orthogonal to that of the first to avoid standing waves and this is achieved with a half-waveplate as indicated in figure \ref{fig:dipole_rig}.

After the second trapping beam has left the vacuum system it is incident on a power meter. The power meter operates with a reflective attenuator and the reflected beam is incident on a photodiode that is used for timing measurements. The final reflection off of the photodiode is safely disposed of with a beam stop.

\subsubsection{Alignment}

The alignment of the crossed \gls{odt} is done but first tuning the seed \gls{ecdl} close to resonance such that when the laser is scanning the saturated absorption signal is visible on the \gls{cro}. With the detuning this low the scattering rate becomes very large and portions of the \gls{mot} are visibly blown away by the \gls{odt} beams when viewed by the \gls{ccd} cameras that monitor flourescence. An example of this is shown in figure \ref{fig:mot_slice}. The level of effect the \gls{odt} beams have on the trapped atoms can be varied by altering the current in the \gls{ta} and the detuning of the \gls{ecdl}. This process allows the two beams to be overlapped in the region of the \gls{mot}.
