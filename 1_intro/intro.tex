The University of Melbourne's \gls{caes} project aims to create high-brightness,  high-coherence electron bunches for use in coherent electron diffractive imaging. The imaging of nanoscale objects such as biological molecules \cite{dwyer_femtosecond_2006, williamson_clocking_1997} and defects in solid-state devices \cite{siwick_atomic-level_2003} by ultrafast, single-shot electron diffractive imaging could provide important information about structures and dynamic processes of important biological molecules such as membrane proteins.

\section{Imaging of Bio-molecules}

In order to determine the structure of biological molecules imaging techniques with atomics resolution are required. A number of techniques are capable of determining these structures \cite{nettleship_methods_2008, svergun_small-angle_2003, opella_structure_2004} and the most successful to date has been x-ray crystallography \cite{kendrew_three-dimensional_1958, uson_advances_1999}. Unfortunately the crystallisation process is difficult and to date only a small proportion of proteins have been successfully crystallised \cite{geerlof_impact_2006}.

\subsection{Membrane Proteins}
Membrane proteins are the proteins that are associated with or attached to the membranes of cells. They are involved in detecting and conveying external signals into cells. This allows the cells to interact with and respond to their environment\cite{almen_mapping_2009}. Membrane proteins are important in determining immune responses, interactions with pharmaceuticals, cell adhesion to form tissues and in controlling important metabolic processes such as salt balance, energy production and photosynthesis\cite{chiras_human_2011}.

Determining the structure of theses molecules is a key step in understanding their chemical and biological function. The importance of knowing the atomic structure of biomolecules is exemplified by the enormous progress made in various fields of biology once the double-helical structure of DNA was determined from x-ray images in 1953 \cite{watson_molecular_1953}. Once a protein's structure and function are known then it becomes possible to design drugs \cite{pinto_influenza_1992} where needed and to more fully understand how the protein behaves in its biological system.

The developement of new imaging techniques, such as ultrafast single shot diffraction, and new light sources, such as \glspl{xfel}, have been driven by the goal of overcoming the limitations of x-ray crystallography. Ultrafast single-shot diffraction imaging also has the potential to able to determine the dynamic structure of biological molecules.



\subsection{Ultrafast, single-shot, coherent diffractive imaging with electrons}

X-ray diffraction from crystals was first observed a century ago\cite{bragg_x-rays_1912} and resulted in a Nobel prize being awarded to William Bragg and his son. Since then \gls{cdi} has been performed on a myriad of different samples with coherent beams of x-rays and electrons.

Ultrafast, single-shot imaging requires a very bright source of radiation in order to provide enough scattered information on the detector before the sample takes damage from the illumination\cite{henderson_potential_1995}. Single-shot imaging with a sufficiently bright source and a short enough interaction time would be able to image protein molecules, and other bio-molecules, without the need for crystallisation\cite{neutze_potential_2000}.

With femtosecond timescale single-shot imaging it is possible to observe such things as molecular vibration and dynamic chemical processes\cite{zewail_4d_2006}. With the sophisticated imaging techniques currently in development and the continued improvement of radiation sources it will become possible to create `molecular movies'\cite{dwyer_femtosecond_2006} of these processes.

Unfortunately, the brightnesses required for single shot imaging requires multi-billion-dollar \gls{xfel} facilities. Electron sources however may be able to provide cheaper alternatives. Electron interactions with molecules are significantly stronger than those of x-rays. For similar energies the electron interaction with a sample is $10^5-10^6$ times stronger than that of x-rays\cite{sciaini_femtosecond_2011}.

\section{Melbourne cold-atom electron source}

The University of Melbourne's \gls{caes} project aims to produce an electron source for coherent diffractive imaging. If bright, coherent, femtosecond long bunches of electrons can be produced then \gls{cdi} can be performed on a range of structures and eventually molecules.

In order to produce the electrons Rubidium atoms are cooled and trapped in a retro-reflective \gls{mot} that is loaded from a Zeeman slower\cite{phillips_laser_1982, phillips_cooling_1987, bell_slow_2010}. The valance electrons of the trapped atoms are ionised using a red (780 nm) and a blue (480 nm) laser.

The wavelength of the blue ionisation laser is tuned such that the electrons are given the minimum energy required to ionise them ensuring that the electrons are `cold' (approximately 10K\cite{mcculloch_arbitrarily_2011}).

The cold electrons are accelerated out of the cloud by a uniform electric field generated by charged parallel plates, guided to the neighbouring sample chamber and focused onto the target sample. After passing through the sample the resulting diffraction pattern is incident upon the detector. The diffraction pattern recorded by the detector can be used to determine the structure of the sample using standard \gls{cdi} techniques.

During the ionisation and acceleration stage the magnetic and optical trapping must be turned off. The optical trapping interferes with the exitation stage and the magnetic trapping would have extremely strong affects on the electron paths due to the low mass of the electrons. This means that, during these phases, the atom-cloud is no longer trapped and begins to expand and fall.

This cycle of trapping, ionisation, acceleration and imaging occurs with a frequency of 10 Hz during normal operation.

\section{Stability of the cold-atom electron source}

In its current state the \gls{caes} suffers from a number of technical issues that are preventing the observation of diffraction through samples. One of these issues is the stability of the atom-cloud and thus the electron signal.

The atom-cloud formed by the \gls{mot} has approximately 93 ms to fill which does not provide enough time for the trap to saturate. The distribution of the atoms within the cloud therefore varies from cycle to cycle. The atom distribution also varies during a single cycle as atoms `slosh' within the trap. These issues are exacerbated when the trapping is turned off and the cloud begins to fall and expand.

This instability in the distribution of the atoms results in instability in the initial distribution of the electrons. This is apparent on the detector as shot-to-shot variations in the position of the electron beam. Removing this instability would make the application of imaging techniques more easier as well as providing more reliable use of the various electron optics in the system.

\section{Optical dipole traps}

\Glspl{odt} may prove to be the solution to this stability problem. An \gls{odt} usually consists of a foccussed, Gaussian laser beam that is detuned from the atomic resonances of the target atomic species. The atoms feel a force towards the high intensity regions of the laser, ie. the centre of the beam and the focus.

\subsection{History of optical dipole trapping}
The use of the optical dipole force as a confining mechanism was first proposed by Askar'yan in 1962\cite{askaryan_effects_1962} for plasmas and neutral atoms. Ashkin successfully demonstrated the trapping of micron-size latex spheres suspended in water using a focused Gaussian lasers in 1970\cite{ashkin_acceleration_1970}. The first optical trapping of atoms was demonstrated by Chu et. al. in 1986\cite{chu_experimental_1986} where a \gls{odt} was used to trap sodium atoms.

Since then \glspl{odt} have been used extensively in atom optics especially in the creation of \glspl{bec} and atom lasers.

\subsection{Optical dipole traps in the cold-atom electron source}

The main advantage of \gls{odt} for the \gls{caes} is trapping without magnetic fields or on-resonance lasers. This means that the atom-cloud can remain trapped during the ionisation and acceleration phases of electron generation. This should reduce the current instability in the electron beam path.

\Gls{odt} also provide the opportunity to experiment with other techniques such as evaporative cooling to compress the atom-cloud and optical lattices\cite{fallani_bose-einstein_2005} to counter disorder induced heating.
